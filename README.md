Twitter Stock/Keyword Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Twitter data to extract insights related to specific keywords or stock symbols. By collecting tweets that mention given keywords or symbols, we aim to perform sentiment analysis, trend analysis, and frequency analysis. The outcomes can aid in understanding public perception, trending topics, and the sentiment around specific stocks or general keywords over time.

Features
Keyword Tracking: Track tweets containing specified keywords or stock symbols.
Sentiment Analysis: Determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of tweets to gauge public perception.
Trend Analysis: Analyze the frequency and trends of keywords or symbols over time.
Visualization: Use ggplot2 to create insightful visualizations of the data, including sentiment over time and keyword frequency trends.
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need:

R (version 4.0 or higher is recommended)
Twitter API credentials
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install necessary R packages by running the following command in R or RStudio:

r
Copy code
install.packages(c("rtweet", "tidyverse", "lubridate", "ggplot2", "tm", "syuzhet"))
Set up Twitter API credentials by creating a .Renviron file in your project directory with the following content, replacing your_* with your actual Twitter API keys:

makefile
Copy code
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY="your_consumer_key"
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET="your_consumer_secret"
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token"
TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET="your_access_secret"
Usage
Configure the script with the keywords or stock symbols you wish to analyze by modifying the keywords variable.
Run the script to start collecting and analyzing Twitter data. The script will perform sentiment analysis and trend analysis based on the collected tweets.
View the results through the generated plots, which provide visual insights into the sentiment and trends associated with your specified keywords or symbols.
Example Analysis
Included in the project are example analyses that demonstrate how to perform sentiment analysis on tweets mentioning specific stock symbols and visualize the frequency of these mentions over time.

Visualization
The project uses ggplot2 for data visualization, providing clear and informative graphs that illustrate the sentiment trends and keyword frequencies.

Future Work
Enhance the data collection process to gather a larger dataset for more comprehensive analysis.
Implement more advanced natural language processing techniques for better sentiment accuracy.
Explore additional forms of analysis, such as topic modeling or network analysis, to uncover deeper insights from the Twitter data.
